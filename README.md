# AniExe

# Offline Local-Anime-Launcher setup for *your* chosen Launcher.

**AniExe** provides a EXE (.exe) that you can input into a launcher library of your liking (be it Heroic Games Launcher, Playnite, Steam or others), it essentially launches *mpv.net* (Currently, the most optimal media player for Anime, as fanSubs optimise for MPV.) and starts playing the *season* of the Anime series, resuming relibly where you left off, with Quality-of-life media player additives, with this configuration, you only have click *play* on your launcher, and it will start with playing from the first episode, full-screened. You can enjoy Anime without any other worries such as full-screening, starting each episode seperately etc. It is currently made for per-season folders, and launcher entries.

This way, you can track the "Watchtime" of your session via your launcher (essentially the EXE's "playtime"), Set **Custom Artwork** for the specific Anime series, and enjoy a clean local-library view.
